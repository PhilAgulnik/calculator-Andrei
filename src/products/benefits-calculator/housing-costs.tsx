                    The number of bedrooms a household needs can be increased in certain
                    circumstances. Special rules affect the following groups:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A disabled adult, child or non-dependant who needs overnight care from a
                      non-resident carer or group of carers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      An adult couple who are unable to share a room because of a disability or a
                      disabled child who would be expected to share a bedroom but cannot share
                      because of a disability
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Foster carers between placements if they have fostered a child, or became a
                      foster parent, within the last 12 months.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Households with adult children in the armed forces who are away from home
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    If you qualify under any of these exemptions please say 'yes' to the question
                    below and we will include an extra bedroom in your calculation. The rules in
                    this area are complicated and you may need to take advice on your individual
                    situation.
