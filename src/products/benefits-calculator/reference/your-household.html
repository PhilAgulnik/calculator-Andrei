    <p>
      If someone in your household is ill, or you have been told to self-isolate for another reason,
      you may be entitled to some help.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Employed?</strong> If your employer does not offer paid sick leave you may be able to
      claim <a href="javascript:gotoHelpPage('SSP');">Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)</a>. In the next few
      pages of the calculator please:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Choose 'Current claim' for the question ‘Do you receive a disability or sickness benefit ?’
        followed by ‘Statutory Sick Pay’ in the list provided.
      </li>
      <li>Enter your current work hours as 0.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Self-employed or not eligible for SSP?</strong> Any entitlements will be based on both
      the circumstances of your household as well as your previous work history and national
      insurance contributions. As you go through the calculator we will check these details and work
      out which benefits you may be entitled to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Already claiming benefits?</strong> Please read the coronavirus help page (click the i
      above) as guidance on what you need to report varies depending of what benefits you are
      already claiming.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your income has gone down because you (or someone else in your household) are working fewer
      hours, have been asked to take unpaid leave, or any self-employed earnings have reduced, you
      may be entitled to claim some benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your entitlements will be based on the circumstances of your entire household, so as you go
      through the calculator we will ask about your circumstances to be able to work out which
      benefits you may be entitled to.
